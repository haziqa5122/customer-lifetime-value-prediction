# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is essential for understanding the long-term revenue potential of customers. This repository provides a comprehensive guide to predicting CLV using transactional, demographic, and behavioral data. It employs statistical models such as BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma, combining them to calculate accurate CLV values for targeted business strategies.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Data Requirements:** Includes transactional, demographic, and behavioral data.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and validate data quality.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create features like total sales per transaction and an RFM table (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value).

### 2. Modeling
- **BG/NBD Model:** Predicts the number of future transactions for each customer.
- **Gamma-Gamma Model:** Estimates the monetary value of customer transactions.
- **Customer Lifetime Value:** Combines outputs from both models to calculate CLV.

### 3. Validation
- Compare predicted CLV with manual calculations using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### 4. Insights and Applications
- Generate actionable insights for marketing teams to enhance customer retention and maximize revenue.
- Segment customers for personalized campaigns using CLV and RFM analysis.
